        <h2><u>Dragon Project Revison and Reflection</u></h2>
    <p>I asked one of my friends to look at my website and see what else I could do in order to make it better. She had quite a few things to say. She stated that my website could use more imagery and get more into the CSS. She also stated that the colors may be too bland. She wanted to cool blues to match the header SpaceX logo. Instead, I had grey and black. I understand why those colors would be seen as bland. I fixed my errors. I did indeed at more pictures and made the color scheme blue and orange. I thought it would be fitting considering when a spaceship takes off, it give off fire.</p>
    <p>As I reflect on what I did on the project, the learning curve for me was definitely the CSS. I do not quite understand  it completely and it is the more difficult thing for me to get correct. During this project, I started to understand it a lot better. I also started understanding the make-up of the index.html better. When I start over for the Revision. The make-up of the website will be more uniform. The CSS will be more resolute and conformed. The CSS is my main target, as that is what my weak area is.</p>
